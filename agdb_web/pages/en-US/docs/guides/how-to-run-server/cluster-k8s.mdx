# How to run the cluster in Kubernetes?

The `agdb_server` can be run in Kubernetes using official Docker image. Optionally you can [build the image](https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/blob/main/agdb_server/containerfile) yourself and host it at your the place of your choosing. Please refer to the [server-docker](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/server-docker) guide for available images.

### Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (you can enable local K8s cluster in Docker Desktop)
- kubectl

### Stateful set yaml

You can find an example Kubernetes deployment at https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/tree/main/examples/k8s

The example breakdown:

<Steps>

### Service

First we deploy the K8s service of type `ClusterIP` that only allows communication inside the cluster. As we are running a database servers it would typically serve other backends in the same cluster and not be accessible from the outside. If such access is needed consider using `LoadBalancer` type service or `Ingress` controller with the `ClusterIp` service. The port available in the cluster is `3000` under a name of `agdb`. Furthermore we specify selector value `app: agdb` and also a label of the same value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: agdb
    labels:
        app: agdb
spec:
    ports:
        - port: 3000
          name: agdb
    clusterIP: None
    selector:
        app: agdb
```

<Callout type="warning">
    When accessing the database cluster through the service name each request
    will be sent to random node (the sessions are not sticky) that may lead to
    inconsistent view into the cluster's data. Consider specifying a pod to
    connect to. Instead of `http://agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000` use for
    example `http://agdb-0.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000`.
</Callout>

### Secret

Next document is the pepper secret `agdb-pepper`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: agdb-pepper
    labels:
        app: agdb
stringData:
    pepper: "1234567891234567"
```

### ConfigMap

The configuration named `agdb-config` via the `ConfigMap` is required as we need specific configuration for each node. Additionally we specify a custom `start.sh` script that dynamically assigns the deployment index as a cluster index on startup.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: agdb-config
    labels:
        app: agdb
data:
    start.sh: |
        cp /agdb/config/agdb_server.yaml /agdb/agdb_server.yaml
        sed -i "s/{id}/$AGDB_REPLICA_INDEX/g" /agdb/agdb_server.yaml
        /usr/local/bin/agdb_server
    agdb_server.yaml: |
        bind: :::3000
        address: http://agdb-{id}.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000
        basepath: ""
        admin: admin
        log_level: INFO
        data_dir: /agdb/data
        pepper_path: /agdb/pepper/pepper
        cluster_token: cluster
        cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
        cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
        cluster: [http://agdb-0.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000, http://agdb-1.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000, http://agdb-2.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000]
```

### StatefulSet

The main part of the deployment is the stateful set definition. It uses the selector and labels `app: agdb` in order to "link" the service and the underlying pods together. Kubernetes is using selectors rather than direct mapping when linking various things together such as services and pods. We specify 3 replicas as we want to run 3 node cluster.

The container spec matches the port on the service by name `agdb` and exposes the container port `3000` (default). The security context specifies the user `1000` (default uid in the container) and disables root access as it is not needed and enhances security.

Finally we specify volumes and volume mounts to add the `secret`, `configmap` and persistent volume claim (PVC) to the expected locations. The PVC is a way how data can survive restart or redeployment. By default 1 GB of storage is specified which can be increased (but not decreased) in subsequent deployments.

The custom command running the `start.sh` from the configmap and the environment variale `AGDB_REPLICA_INDEX` make sure the correct config is assigned to each node on startup.

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: agdb
  labels:
    app: agdb
spec:
  serviceName: "agdb"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agdb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agdb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: agdb
          image: agnesoft/agdb:dev
          command: ["sh", "/agdb/config/start.sh"]
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: agdb
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1000
            runAsGroup: 1000
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          env:
            - name: AGDB_REPLICA_INDEX
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['apps.kubernetes.io/pod-index']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: agdb-data
              mountPath: /agdb/data
            - name: config
              mountPath: /agdb/config
            - name: pepper
              mountPath: /agdb/pepper
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: agdb-config
            defaultMode: 511
        - name: pepper
          secret:
            secretName: agdb-pepper
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: agdb-data
        labels:
          app: agdb
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi

```

### Test that the server is up with `curl`

The following command must be run from within the cluster unless the server was exposed via `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress`. The `.default.` bit is the name of the namespace where everything was deployed.

```bash
curl -v http://agdb-0.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/v1/status # should return 200 OK
curl -v http://agdb-1.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/v1/status # should return 200 OK
curl -v http://agdb-2.agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/v1/status # should return 200 OK
```

### Additional considerations

- You could use the `localhost:3000/api/v1/status` as a startup/readiness/health probe.
- Standard shutdown procedure via the endpoint will not work as K8s will simply restart the servers.
- You should be able to adapt the above to other platforms such as AWS EKS.
- Always connect to a particular node (e.g. `agdb-0`) rather than the service address since the latter will route the request to a random node.
