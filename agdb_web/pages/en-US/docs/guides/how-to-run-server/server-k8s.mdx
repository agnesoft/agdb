# How to run the server in Kubernetes?

The `agdb_server` can be run in Kubernetes using official Docker image. Optionally you can [build the image](https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/blob/main/agdb_server/containerfile) yourself and host it at your the place of your choosing. Please refer to the [server-docker](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/server-docker) guide for available images.

<Callout>
    This guide is for running `agdb_server` as a single instance. This is only
    recommended when resiliency is not required and/or if speed is of the
    essence. Consider running
    [cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) instead.
</Callout>

### Requirements

-   Kubernetes cluster (you can enable local K8s cluster in Docker Desktop)
-   kubectl

### Stateful set yaml

You can find an example Kubernetes deployment at https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/tree/main/examples/k8s

The example breakdown:

<Steps>

### Service

First we deploy the K8s service of type `ClusterIP` that only allows communication inside the cluster. As we are running a database server it would typically serve other backends in the same cluster and not be accessible from the outside. If such access is needed consider using `LoadBalancer` type service or `Ingress` controller with the `ClusterIp` service. The port available in the cluster is `3000` under a name of `agdb`. Furthermore we specify selector value `app: agdb` and also a label of the same value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: agdb
    labels:
        app: agdb
spec:
    ports:
        - port: 3000
          name: agdb
    clusterIP: None
    selector:
        app: agdb
```

### Secret

Next document is the pepper secret `agdb-pepper`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: agdb-pepper
    labels:
        app: agdb
stringData:
    pepper: "1234567891234567"
```

### ConfigMap

The configuration named `agdb-config` via the `ConfigMap` is optional as the default configuration would work just as well. It might however be useful if you needed to change anything regarding the server later.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: agdb-config
    labels:
        app: agdb
data:
    agdb_server.yaml: |
        bind: :::3000
        address: http://agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000
        basepath: ""
        admin: admin
        log_level: INFO
        data_dir: /agdb/data
        pepper_path: /agdb/pepper/pepper
        cluster_token: cluster
        cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
        cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
        cluster: []
```

### StatefulSet

The main part of the deployment is the stateful set definition. While replica set could work to some extent the instances of `agdb_server` are not interchangable and cannot be freely scaled horizontally. The stateful set type is therefore a better fit. It uses the selector and labels `app: agdb` in order to "link" the service and the underlying pod together. Kubernetes is using selectors rather than direct mapping when linking various things together such as services and pods. We specify 1 replica only (refer to the [agdb as K8s cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) for an alternative).

The container spec matches the port on the service by name `agdb` and exposes the containe port `3000` (default). The security context specifies the user `1000` (default uid in the container) and disables root access as it is not needed and enhances security.

Finally we specify volumes and volume mounts to add the `secret`, `configmap` and persistent volume claim (PVC) to the expected locations. The PVC is a way how data can survive restart or redeployment. By default 1 GB of storage is specified which can be increased (but not decreased) in subsequent deployments.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: agdb
  labels:
    app: agdb
spec:
  serviceName: "agdb"
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agdb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agdb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: agdb
          image: agnesoft/agdb:dev
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: agdb
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1000
            runAsGroup: 1000
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          volumeMounts:
            - name: agdb-data
              mountPath: /agdb/data
            - name: config
              mountPath: /agdb
            - name: pepper
              mountPath: /agdb/pepper
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: agdb-config
            defaultMode: 511
        - name: pepper
          secret:
            secretName: agdb-pepper
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: agdb-data
        labels:
          app: agdb
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

### Test that the server is up with `curl`

The following command must be run from within the cluster unless the server was exposed via `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress`. The `.default.` bit is the name of the namespace where the everything was deployed.

```bash
curl -v http://agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/v1/status # should return 200 OK
```

### Additional considerations

-   You could use the `localhost:3000/api/v1/status` as a startup/readiness/health probe
-   Standard shutdown procedure via the endpoint will not work as K8s will simply restart the server
-   Consider running the [cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) rather than just a single node.
-   You shoul be able to adapt the above to other platforms such as AWS EKS.
