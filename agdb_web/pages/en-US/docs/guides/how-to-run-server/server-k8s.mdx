# How to run the server in Kubernetes?

The `agdb_server` can be run in Kubernetes using official Docker image. Optionally you can [build the image](https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/blob/main/agdb_server/containerfile) yourself and host it at your the place of your choosing. Please refer to the [server-docker](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/server-docker) guide for available images.

<Callout>
    This guide is for running `agdb_server` as a single instance. This is only
    recommended when resiliency is not required and/or if speed is of the
    essence. Consider running
    [cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) instead.
</Callout>

### Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (you can enable local K8s cluster in Docker Desktop)
- kubectl

### Stateful set yaml

You can find an example Kubernetes deployment at https://github.com/agnesoft/agdb/tree/main/examples/k8s

The example breakdown:

<Steps>

### Service

First we deploy the K8s service of type `ClusterIP` that only allows communication inside the cluster. As we are running a database server it would typically serve other backends in the same cluster and not be accessible from the outside. If such access is needed consider using `LoadBalancer` type service or `Ingress` controller with the `ClusterIp` service. The port available in the cluster is `3000` under a name of `agdb`. Furthermore we specify selector value `app: agdb` and also a label of the same value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: agdb
    labels:
        app: agdb
spec:
    ports:
        - port: 3000
          name: agdb
    clusterIP: None
    selector:
        app: agdb
```

### Secrets

Next document is the pepper secret `agdb-pepper`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: agdb-pepper
    labels:
        app: agdb
stringData:
    pepper: "1234567891234567"
```

Followed by the certificates. In production you should create the certificates using kubectl command from secure files rather than embedding them into the manifest. However, for demonstration purposes the following example is provided. It uses self-signed certificate with the corresponding CA. It needs to be provided as `base64` value. You can use e.g. `cat cert.pem | base64` bash command to get the correct value (end of lines do not matter).

<Callout>
    The certificate must be issued (or used as an alternative name - SAN) for
    the DNS name of the server used in its configuration `address` field. E.g.
    `agdb.default.svc.cluster.local`.
</Callout>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: agdb-certs
    labels:
        app: agdb
data:
    cert.pem: ...
    key.pem: ...
    root_ca.pem: ...
```

### ConfigMap

The configuration named `agdb-config` via the `ConfigMap` is optional as the default configuration would work just as well. It might however be useful if you needed to change anything regarding the server later. For example disabling TLS if it is not needed etc.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: agdb-config
    labels:
        app: agdb
data:
    agdb_server.yaml: |
        bind: :::3000
        address: http://agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000
        basepath: ""
        static_roots: []
        admin: admin
        log_level: INFO
        data_dir: /agdb/data
        pepper_path: /agdb/pepper/pepper
        tls_certificate: /agdb/certs/cert.pem
        tls_key: /agdb/certs/key.pem
        tls_root: /agdb/certs/root_ca.pem
        cluster_token: cluster
        cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
        cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
        cluster: []
```

### StatefulSet

The main part of the deployment is the stateful set definition. While replica set could work to some extent the instances of `agdb_server` are not interchangeable and cannot be freely scaled horizontally. The stateful set type is therefore a better fit. It uses the selector and labels `app: agdb` in order to "link" the service and the underlying pod together. Kubernetes is using selectors rather than direct mapping when linking various things together such as services and pods. We specify 1 replica only (refer to the [agdb as K8s cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) for an alternative).

The container spec matches the port on the service by name `agdb` and exposes the container port `3000` (default). The security context specifies the user `1000` (default uid in the container) and disables root access as it is not needed and enhances security.

Finally, we specify volumes and volume mounts to add the `secrets`, `configmap` and persistent volume claim (PVC) to the expected locations. The PVC is a way how data can survive restart or redeployment. By default, 1 GB of storage is specified which can be increased (but not decreased) in subsequent deployments. Certificates are provided for TLS support.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: agdb
  labels:
    app: agdb
spec:
  serviceName: "agdb"
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agdb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agdb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: agdb
          image: agnesoft/agdb:dev
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: agdb
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1000
            runAsGroup: 1000
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          volumeMounts:
            - name: agdb-data
              mountPath: /agdb/data
            - name: config
              mountPath: /agdb
            - name: pepper
              mountPath: /agdb/pepper
            - name: certs
              mountPath: /agdb/certs
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: agdb-config
            defaultMode: 511
        - name: pepper
          secret:
            secretName: agdb-pepper
        - name: certs
          secret:
            secretName: agdb-certs
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: agdb-data
        labels:
          app: agdb
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

### Test that the server is up with `curl`

The following command must be run from within the cluster unless the server was exposed via `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress`. The `.default.` bit is the name of the namespace where everything was deployed.

```bash
curl -v https://agdb.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/v1/status # should return 200 OK
```

### Additional considerations

- You could use the `localhost:3000/api/v1/status` as a startup/readiness/health probe.
- Standard shutdown procedure via the endpoint will not work as K8s will simply restart the server.
- Consider running the [cluster](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/cluster-k8s) rather than just a single node.
- You should be able to adapt the above to other platforms such as AWS EKS.
- If you are using `agdb` only inside the K8s cluster with no visibility outside of it you may want to disable TLS.
- If you are exposing `agdb` outside the K8s cluster use real production certificate. In that case leave the `tls_root` configuration option empty.
