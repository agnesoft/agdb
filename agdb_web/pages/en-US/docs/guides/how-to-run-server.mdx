# How to run the server?

The `agdb_server` can be run in multiple ways. The following table directs you to the correct documentation based on your use case. It differentiates between running the server as a single server or as a cluster of multiple replicated nodes (using Raft consensus protocol). The documentation is provided for running the server on bare metal, using docker or Kubernetes (K8s). Please refer to the [server](/docs/references/server) documentation for general information.

| Type / Target | Bare Metal                              | Docker                              | K8s                              |
