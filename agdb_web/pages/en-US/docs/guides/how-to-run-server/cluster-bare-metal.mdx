# How to run the cluster on bare metal?

The `agdb_server` can be run as a cluster on bare metal. First you should build the server as described in the [server - bare metal](/docs/guides/how-to-run-server/server-bare-metal) guide. In the following steps we will run a cluster of 3 nodes on a local machine however it should work essentially the same even when each server was run on its own machine:

<Steps>

### Prepare cluster configuration

First we create the configuration files for our nodes. Notice that the only difference is the port in the address option. As described in the main [server](/docs/references/server) documentation the address field determines the index of the local node (position in the cluster list). The list of nodes is then the same and having the same order for each instance as it provides the cluster "hash" for establishing trust in the cluster (in addition to the `cluster_token`):

```yaml
#node0: ~/agdb_cluster/node0/agdb_server.yaml
bind: :::3000
address: http://localhost:3000
basepath: ""
admin: admin
log_level: INFO
data_dir: agdb_server_data
pepper_path: ""
tls_certificate: ""
tls_key: ""
tls_root: ""
cluster_token: cluster
cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
cluster: [http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3001, http://localhost:3002]

#node1: ~/agdb_cluster/node1/agdb_server.yaml
bind: :::3000
address: http://localhost:3001
basepath: ""
admin: admin
log_level: INFO
data_dir: agdb_server_data
pepper_path: ""
tls_certificate: ""
tls_key: ""
tls_root: ""
cluster_token: cluster
cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
cluster: [http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3001, http://localhost:3002]

#node2: ~/agdb_cluster/node2/agdb_server.yaml
bind: :::3000
address: http://localhost:3002
basepath: ""
admin: admin
log_level: INFO
data_dir: agdb_server_data
pepper_path: ""
tls_certificate: ""
tls_key: ""
tls_root: ""
cluster_token: cluster
cluster_heartbeat_timeout_ms: 1000
cluster_term_timeout_ms: 3000
cluster: [http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3001, http://localhost:3002]
```

### Run the server

Next we run all 3 nodes as background processes in their respective directories with the prepared config files. It is recommended to run each in its own shell so you can observe the logs otherwise they would be all writing to the same shell if run as background processes (i.e. `agdb_server &`). If you decide to run all of them in the same shell each log messages clearly indicates to which node it belongs using the node's index (e.g. `[0]`, `[1]` etc.)

```bash
cd ~/agdb_cluster/node0/ #run each node in its respective directory
agdb_server
```

### Test that the cluster is up with `curl`

The following commands will hit each node and return the list of nodes, their status and which one is the leader. If the servers are connected and operating normally the returned list should be the same from each node.

```bash
curl -v localhost:3000/api/v1/cluster/status
curl -v localhost:3001/api/v1/cluster/status
curl -v localhost:3002/api/v1/cluster/status
```

### Shutdown the servers

The cluster must be shutdown one by one using the same mechanism as with single server including the `CTRL+C`. Using curl:

```bash
# this will produce an admin API token, e.g. "bb2fc207-90d1-45dd-8110-3247c4753cd5"
token=$(curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:3000/api/v1/user/login -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}')
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/shutdown

token=$(curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:3001/api/v1/user/login -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}')
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" localhost:3001/api/v1/admin/shutdown

token=$(curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:3002/api/v1/user/login -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}')
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" localhost:3002/api/v1/admin/shutdown
```

While it is technically possible to use cluster login and avoid logins to each node separately it might be fragile and not work well in situations where the cluster is in the bad shapes with nodes not being available etc. Local login and shutdown are guaranteed to work regardless of the overall cluster status.
